        <h3>Work Philosophy</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In my journey through life, I've learned a fundamental truth:
          <i>initiative drives progress</i>. I believe in taking ownership of my
          responsibilities and embracing self-reliance, while also recognizing
          the power of collaboration. Together, as a cohesive team, we can
          achieve far more than we could alone. Clarity in our common goals
          ensures that every decision aligns with our collective purpose,
          fostering unity and driving us toward success.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the pursuit of productivity and excellence, I uphold a commitment
          to continuous improvement and quality. Striving for competency and
          impact, both as an individual and within organizations, it is
          essential for driving meaningful outcomes and achieving success. My
          aspiration to work remotely stems not only from a desire to reclaim
          valuable time lost in a taxing commute but also from a belief in the
          benefits of a focused and peaceful home workspace. While I value
          face-to-face interactions and collaboration, I aim to minimize
          unnecessary distractions and optimize my productivity by embracing
          remote work as part of my daily routine.

          <h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>
            My ambition is to ascend to the role of lead developer and
            ultimately lead a dynamic and innovative development studio. To
            achieve this goal, I am committed to continuously honing my
            technical skills, mastering emerging technologies, and refining my
            leadership abilities. In my current role, I orchestrate feature
            plans, establish project timelines, and meticulously document my
            code, all while prioritizing user-centric design principles and best
            practices. I actively seek opportunities to deepen my understanding
            of the entire software development life cycle (SDLC) and contribute
            to cross-functional collaboration within my team. By embracing
            ongoing learning and professional development, I aim to position
            myself as a visionary leader capable of guiding teams to deliver
            exceptional software solutions that drive positive impact and
            innovation.

        </div>
        <p>
          As a dedicated front-end developer at CodeStream Studios LLC for the
          past five years, I spearheaded the development of the company's
          React.js application. I played a key role in shaping its entire
          front-end architecture from inception to execution. Leveraging my
          expertise, I meticulously planned and executed the implementation of
          key features, including the creation of a custom made "Markdown
          Editor", a versatile three-panel editor supporting both Web<small
            >(HTML, CSS, JavaScript) </small
          >and Python projects, an intuitive organization and classroom
          management system, and an innovative curriculum building and
          publishing platform. Additionally, I contributed to the development of
          a custom VS Code extension, currently pending release, showcasing my
          commitment to pushing boundaries and delivering cutting-edge solutions
          in software development.

        <p>
          In 2019, I had the honor of participating in the Daimler Trucking
          Hackathon in Austin, Texas. Tasked with improving the repair process
          for the company, I joined forces with fellow junior developers after
          being initially overlooked by senior teams. Despite the odds, our
          collaborative effort resulted in a resounding victory, outperforming
          20 other teams comprised of senior developers. By prioritizing the
          client's actual needs and delivering a solution tailored to their
          specific challenges, we emerged triumphant, showcasing our ability to
          innovate and deliver impactful solutions under pressure.

        <p>
          Tech Talent South provided me with a comprehensive three-month
          full-time bootcamp experience in downtown Dallas, where I delved into
          the world of Java programming. While the curriculum primarily focused
          on Java and Spring Boot, the experience was instrumental in honing my
          skills in understanding and navigating Java code. It's also where I
          discovered my preference for front end development. Though my time at
          Tech Talent South was brief, the exposure to Java has provided me with
          valuable insights into the intricacies of programming languages and
          software development.

        <p>
          My software development journey began at SMU's coding bootcamp, where
          I acquired foundational skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and
          Express.js over a transformative six-month part-time course. It was
          here that I first encountered React.js, igniting my passion for
          front-end development, which has since become the focus of my career.
          This bootcamp laid the groundwork and sparked my desire to venture
          into the world of web development.
