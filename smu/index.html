          My experience at Southern Methodist University (SMU) was a
          transformative journey that served as my initial foray into the world
          of programming. Throughout my time at SMU, I honed fundamental skills
          in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and React.js, laying
          the groundwork for my career as a developer. This dedicated page
          serves as a testament to the skills and knowledge acquired during my
          educational journey, showcasing three pivotal projects: "Gif Freak,"
          my inaugural project where I delved into utilizing APIs; "Stock
          Memer," my first collaborative endeavor exploring group dynamics in
          development; and "Scion Matches," the culmination of my SMU
          experience, demonstrating my proficiency in teamwork and project
          management. Each project offers a glimpse into the lessons learned and
          the growth achieved during my time at SMU, highlighting the foundation
          upon which my career in software development has been built.

        <h3>Gif Freak</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          "Gif Freak" is a dynamic and interactive website developed as part of
          my educational journey at SMU. Deployed on GitHub Pages, this project
          showcases my proficiency in HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax. The
          website leverages the Giphy API to fetch and display gifs based on
          user input. Upon loading, the site presents users with pre-defined
          buttons, each triggering the display of the most relevant gif
          retrieved from the API. Additionally, users have the option to create
          custom buttons tailored to their preferences, initiating requests for
          and displaying a selection of up to 10 gifs associated with the
          specified search term. These user-generated buttons are dynamically
          added to the master list, enhancing the website's functionality and
          user experience. Notably, user-created buttons are only stored
          temporarily within the session, since I did not know a way to save
          information at that time. "Gif Freak" demonstrates my ability to
          integrate multiple technologies early in my education. While simple
          and quite rough to look at the code now this was the project that
          really lit my fire of inspiration as to what I could do as a developer
          and actually have fun when developing.

        <h3>Stock Memer</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          "Stock Memer" represents a collaborative effort and marks my first
          venture into group project development during my time at SMU. This web
          application provides users with the ability to view real-time stock
          price data for companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
          Alongside the stock graph, users can access a summary of key
          information related to the selected company. Additionally, "Stock
          Memer" offers a unique feature allowing users to generate memes
          related to specific stocks and post them directly to the corresponding
          stock's page. Memes and their associations with stock IDs are stored
          in Google Firebase. Although the database functionality is no longer
          operational due to the expiration of the meme generator API key,
          preventing users from creating memes to save, the stock price/trend
          API system and graphs remain functional on the deployed version.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project, my primary responsibilities included creating the API
          and database interactions, while my teammates focused on designing the
          user interface and implementing graph generation based on the data
          retrieved from the APIs. "Stock Memer" exemplifies my ability to
          collaborate effectively within a team setting, showcasing my
          contributions to the project's backend development and database
          management.

        <h3>Scion Matches</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          "Scion Matches" represents a significant milestone in my journey as a
          developer, serving as my final project at SMU. The website was
          conceived with the aim of revolutionizing the intricate process of
          matching Intended Parents (IPs) with Gestational Carriers (GCs) within
          the realm of surrogacy. Recognizing the substantial time and financial
          investments inherent in this journey, "Scion Matches" was designed to
          alleviate the burdens by facilitating connections based on
          compatibility and preferences. Users would create accounts and undergo
          a comprehensive survey, providing detailed insights into their
          backgrounds, desires, and expectations. Leveraging my expertise, I
          developed the matching algorithm that meticulously compared users'
          responses, generating match scores to identify the most compatible
          pairings. This algorithm formed the backbone of the platform, enabling
          seamless matchmaking and empowering users to request connections with
          utmost confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the deployment URL no longer being in service and the absence
          of archive screenshots, "Scion Matches" remains a pivotal project in
          my portfolio. It signifies a pivotal shift in my approach to software
          development, as I transitioned from building projects for mere
          enjoyment to creating solutions with tangible real-world value. "Scion
          Matches" embodies my commitment to leveraging technology to address
          pressing societal issues, underscoring my determination to make a
          meaningful impact through my work.
