        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The Daimler Trucking Hackathon of 2019 marked a pivotal moment in my
          journey as a developer. Freshly graduated from my second bootcamp, I
          attended the event with a friend, initially just for fun. Little did
          we know, we would be tasked with revolutionizing the repair process
          for the company. Despite being overlooked by senior teams, our group
          of junior developers, including my friend and I, banded together to
          tackle the challenge head-on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Against all odds, our collaborative efforts led to a resounding
          victory, showcasing our ability to deliver practical solutions
          tailored to the client's actual needs. Inspired by our success, some
          of us pooled our winnings to embark on an ambitious endeavor -
          starting a company to develop the app for Daimler. As the sole
          developer who joined in, I faced immense challenges, teaching myself
          React Native to transform the web-based solution into a mobile app.
          However, despite our best efforts, the venture ultimately faltered due
          to the actions of our project leader, who engaged in shady backroom
          deals by signing contracts under his own company rather than the one
          we established with our winnings.

          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <p>
            Help the company technicians in repair and maitinance work along
            with ways to track process speed. This will allow the company to
            understand when and where slowdowns happen. This system needs to be
            hands free as possible and should not require the technician to
            interact with a screen. They also wanted a way for technicians that
            compleated work fater than the average time to give feedback on how
            they did it.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4>The solution</h4>
          <p>
            To address the challenge presented by Daimler, our team leveraged a
            combination of innovative technologies and collaborative expertise.
            We began by utilizing my "MERN App Template" as the foundation for
            the application, taking advantage of its backend capabilities and
            pre-built sign-in process. With this solid groundwork in place, each
            member of the team focused on a specific aspect of the project. One
            teammate developed an .xml parser to efficiently read instruction
            files, while another dedicated their efforts to creating an AWS
            Lambda function to handle inputs and step positions. Meanwhile, my
            friend and I tackled the crucial task of implementing voice
            interactions with the client. This involved designing a seamless
            process for technicians to issue commands vocally, transmitting them
            to the Lambda function, and seamlessly integrating the response back
            into the application. Additionally, we worked on converting the text
            of the current step from the parser into speech, ensuring a fluid
            and intuitive user experience throughout the repair process.
          </p>
          <hr />
          <h4>The outcome</h4>
          <p>
            The app developed during the Daimler Trucking Hackathon provided a
            revolutionary solution to the company's repair and maintenance
            workflow. By leveraging an automated voice system, technicians could
            efficiently access truck information and receive step-by-step
            directions without the need for manual interaction with a screen.
            This hands-free approach not only improved process speed tracking
            but also enhanced technician productivity and satisfaction.
            Additionally, the system allowed technicians to provide valuable
            feedback on their work, enabling continuous improvement and
            optimization of repair procedures. The app's success at the
            hackathon demonstrated its potential to streamline operations and
            drive efficiency within Daimler's repair process.

        <h3 id="tech_assist">Post Hackathon Work (Tech Assist)</h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>Transition</h4>
        <p>
          After the hackathon we made a company and named it "Reinforce" after
          our team name from the hackathon. We also changed the name of the app
          to "Tech Assist" to better represent it as a product of our company. I
          got a co-working space since I did not have a home office at the time
          to develop the app. The client gave us some .xml files with some work
          instructions to use for development and had many changes they wanted
          to make. Primaraliy the desire to make it a moblie app rather than a
          website. I was honsetly in way over my head but I was determined to
          make it work.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>Development & Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          After the hackathon and the establishment of our new company, we
          engaged in several meetings with Daimler to delineate the project's
          scope and objectives. Participating in these discussions was an
          invaluable experience for me, as a relatively inexperienced developer
          at the time. We covered a wide range of topics, including feature
          requirements, implementation strategies, timelines, and budget
          considerations, laying the groundwork for the professional development
          of the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the requirement for a mobile version of the app and the
          ambiguity surrounding the device platform, I decided to initiate
          development using React Native. Leveraging my prior experience with
          React.js, I swiftly adapted to React Native, allowing us to swiftly
          create a rudimentary prototype compatible with both major platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, transitioning to mobile development presented its own set of
          challenges. I needed to migrate the parsing logic to a server and
          develop a micro-service to handle it. Additionally, I faced the task
          of enhancing the parsing logic to accommodate the intricacies of the
          XML documents. Originally written in Python and notably complex, I
          reverse engineered the logic in JavaScript and added the necessary
          complexity to meet our requirements. I did this conversion in two
          weeks, where I also successfully expanded the capabilities of the
          parsing logic, enabling users to access over 500 sets of instructions
          for 5 different trucks solely through voice prompts.
        </p>
        <div class="commandFlow">
          <p>
            As an example of the logic flow, consider the scenario where a
            technician needs to run a <span>[Service_Type]</span> on a
            <span>[Model_Number]</span>. The program first identifies all
            documents associated with the specified model number, filters them
            to locate the document number of the requested service type, and
            then sends the corresponding XML file to the parser micro-service.
            Once parsed, the instructions are returned to the app as an array of
            objects, with each object containing the step instructions as a
            string and an array of sub-steps if applicable, ready to be read
            aloud to the user.

        <h4>Outcome</h4>
        <p>
          Despite the promising start following the hackathon victory, the
          post-hackathon journey ultimately ended in disappointment and
          frustration. While we made significant progress in defining project
          requirements, developing a prototype, and laying the groundwork for
          further development, unforeseen challenges emerged that derailed our
          efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regrettably, the project's downfall stemmed from the actions of our
          team leader, who made unilateral decisions without consulting the rest
          of the team. In a disheartening turn of events, it was discovered that
          the team leader had signed contracts with Daimler under a company he
          owned, sidelining the rest of the team and denying us the opportunity
          to continue our work on the project. Despite my best efforts to
          salvage the situation, I found myself cut out of the project entirely,
          lacking the resources and leverage to rectify the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the outcome was disappointing, the experience served as a
          valuable lesson in the importance of transparency, communication, and
          trust within a team dynamic. Although the project did not materialize
          as intended, the lessons learned and the skills acquired during the
          post-hackathon work have undoubtedly contributed to my growth as a
          developer and have prepared me for future challenges and
          opportunities.
