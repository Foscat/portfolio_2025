        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Throughout my coding journey, I've taken on a range of personal side
          projects, each aimed at addressing real-world challenges and
          showcasing my problem-solving prowess. From developing a greenhouse
          climate control system using a Raspberry Pi to crafting a web-based
          Enigma machine and designing the 'D20 King' app for Dungeon Masters.
          I'm showcasing these particular projects because they not only serve
          practical functions in my life but also reflect my passion for coding.
          I've dedicated myself to exploring innovative ways to leverage
          technology, creating meaningful solutions that merge creativity with
          functionality.

        <h3>Greenhouse Climate Controller</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The "Greenhouse Climate Controller" stands as one of my favorite
          real-world solutions, born out of a desire to address a friend's
          struggle with greenhouse maintenance. Crafted in Python, this project
          was meticulously designed to provide automated oversight and
          optimization for year-round vegetable growth. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi
          Zero at its core, the controller offers a comprehensive solution to
          regulate the greenhouse environment, mitigating the challenges of
          fluctuating conditions in the absence of constant human intervention.
        </p>

          title="Greenhouse control board"
        />
        <p>
          Strategically positioned temperature and humidity sensors, extended
          via CAT5 cable to a centralized location, ensure precise climate
          monitoring. The system dynamically adjusts environmental variables
          using relay-controlled devices, acting as a "smart power strip" to
          manage heaters, fans, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, vents, and lighting
          systems. With three distinct settings - "Veg," "Flower," and "Final
          Flower" - tailored to different growth stages, the controller
          optimizes yield and quality. Collaboratively developed with my
          father's assistance in soldering and wiring, this project embodies our
          shared commitment to innovation. By providing automated oversight, the
          Greenhouse Climate Controller empowers growers to cultivate thriving
          crops with minimal manual intervention, revolutionizing the experience
          of remote monitoring.

        <h3>Caesar's Enigma</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Originally conceived as a Python-based exploration into cipher
          systems, I transformed the concept into a practical tool with a twist.
          Drawing inspiration from both the Caesar cipher and the Enigma
          machine, 'Caesar's Enigma' employs five different alphabets for added
          complexity. Motivated by a desire to learn Python, I initially crafted
          the program for personal amusement, facilitating encrypted exchanges
          of messages within my family circle. However, recognizing its
          potential beyond familial correspondence, I challenged myself to
          reimagine the project in JavaScript, complete with a user-friendly
          interface. This project transcends mere novelty; its relevance extends
          to professional contexts where secure communication is paramount.
          'Caesar's Enigma' serves as a reliable means of safeguarding sensitive
          information during transmission over public networks, ensuring privacy
          and confidentiality.

        <h3>D20 King</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          This app offers a dynamic solution to the challenges faced by Dungeon
          Masters in the realm of tabletop role-playing games, particularly
          Dungeons & Dragons. Built on the foundation of my "MERN App Template
          with BCrypt," this project is more than just a tool; it's a passion
          project born from a genuine love for tabletop gaming. As a Dungeon
          Master myself, I often struggled with proper note-taking and the
          daunting task of crafting new stories. While some apps cater to
          players, there's a noticeable gap in the market for tools that assist
          Dungeon Masters and authors of custom modules. "D20 King" aims to fill
          this void
        </p>
        <img
          src="/portfolio_2025/images/side projects/d20_dashboard.png"
          alt="Screenshot of D20 tabletop campaign creator website"
          title="D20 landing page"
        />
        <p>
          What truly sets "D20 King" apart is its modular architecture, inspired
          by the collaborative spirit of GitHub repositories. Each "Storybook"
          serves as a canvas for storytelling, comprising a tapestry of "Acts"
          and "Rooms" waiting to be filled with adventure. From sprawling
          landscapes to treacherous dungeons, Dungeon Masters have the power to
          populate their worlds with a myriad of "Opponents" and "Treasures,"
          crafting immersive experiences that captivate players' imaginations.
        </p>

          title="Opponent editor"
        />
        <p>
          I am not sharing any of the code nor do I wish to share the
          development environment with anyone. I fully intend on turning this
          into a real product one day and want to keep it relatively private. I
          only mention it here to showcase what I'm capable of and to provide
          insight into my passion for solving real-world problems through
          technology.
