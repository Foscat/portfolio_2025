        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          During my tenure at CodeStream Studios LLC, I served as the sole
          front-end developer, entrusted with the monumental task of crafting
          our React.js application from its conceptual infancy to its
          full-fledged existence. With a meticulous blend of programming prowess
          and strategic planning, I orchestrated the transformation of abstract
          ideas into tangible features that formed the cornerstone of our
          platform. As the architect behind the entire front-end framework, I
          not only coded every aspect of the website but also navigated the
          challenges of a lean team and limited resources. Amidst these
          constraints, I assumed a multifaceted role, extending beyond
          programming to encompass responsibilities such as bug fixing,
          documentation creation, and user testing management. This
          comprehensive approach allowed me to not only bring the platform to
          life but also ensure its functionality and success.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my role as a developer, I also had the unique
          opportunity to serve as an instructor and active user of the platform.
          Utilizing the very system I helped create, I seamlessly integrated it
          into my teaching curriculum, leveraging its capabilities to educate
          and empower students. This firsthand experience as both developer and
          user provided invaluable insights, allowing me to refine and optimize
          the platform with a deep understanding of its practical applications.
          Through this dual perspective, I not only contributed to its
          development but also witnessed firsthand its impact and efficacy in
          real-world educational settings.

          Our platform was designed to provide a comprehensive virtual learning
          experience for middle and high school students, offering a range of
          features tailored to meet the demands of remote education during the
          COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. Here's a brief overview of the core
          functionalities:

            <h6>The Problem:</h6>
            <p>
              We need a way to allow users who are teachers for an organization
              to have a class with curriculum to present to students. When the
              student is in a classroom they can view lessons and resources that
              are part of the course. Both students and teachers will need a
              standard way to access the classroom.

            <h6>The Solution:</h6>
            <p>
              We added <span>Classrooms</span> as a tab on the side navigation
              that all users can see. Once navigating to the page users would
              see a list of all the classrooms they are a part of both teacher
              and student. The classrooms where the user is a teacher display
              the student count of the classroom. Clicking on a classroom will
              navigate the user to the <span>Classroom</span> page where all the
              information about the course is displayed. Here users can view
              resources attached to the course, classroom or lessons as well as
              open a lesson as a project. If the user currently does not have a
              project that matches this lesson it will be cloned and saved as a
              project under the users name and gets a grade entry attached to it
              so the teacher cn grade the project later.

                On the classroom page, we display easy access to lesson
                materials, assignments, and supplementary resources. The
                inclusion of an introductory video offers a dynamic introduction
                to the course content, enhancing engagement and comprehension
                for students.

            <h6>The Problem:</h6>
            <p>
              We need a way to allow users who are teachers for an organization
              to have a class with curriculum to present to students. When the
              student is in a classroom they can view lessons and resources that
              are part of the course. Both students and teachers will need a
              standard way to access the classroom.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h6>The Solution:</h6>
            <p>
              We added <span>Classrooms</span> as a tab on the side navigation
              that all users can see. Once navigating to the page users would
              see a list of all the classrooms they are a part of both teacher
              and student. The classrooms where the user is a teacher display
              the student count of the classroom. Clicking on a classroom will
              navigate the user to the <span>Classroom</span> page where all the
              information about the course is displayed. Here users can view
              resources attached to the course, classroom or lessons as well as
              open a lesson as a project. If the user currently does not have a
              project that matches this lesson it will be cloned and saved as a
              project under the users name and gets a grade entry attached to it
              so the teacher cn grade the project later.

              <p>
                On the course builder users can seamlessly craft courses by
                adding lessons and resources, structuring content to suit the
                needs of their curriculum. Once a lesson is integrated into a
                course, users have the flexibility to attach resources directly
                to individual lessons, enhancing the accessibility and
                comprehensiveness of course materials.

                Users are presented with a convenient popup menu for adding
                lessons to course units within the CSOS platform. The menu
                displays a table of lessons available within the user's
                organization, showcasing the modular nature of lessons and
                resources. Users can easily select and add lessons from this
                centralized repository, promoting efficiency and flexibility in
                curriculum development. This feature underscores the platform's
                commitment to modularity, allowing lessons and resources to be
                utilized across multiple courses and units.

        <hr />
        <p>
          While my tenure at CodeStream Studios LLC was marked by innovation,
          dedication, and relentless pursuit of excellence, the reality of our
          industry's challenges ultimately proved insurmountable for our small
          team. Despite my best efforts as the sole front end developer, and not
          having a backend developer for months at a time. The company faced
          many financial hurdles and management instability, leading to our
          unfortunate closure. However, this experience has been invaluable in
          shaping me into a resilient and adaptable developer, equipped with a
          diverse skill set and a deep understanding of the intricacies of
          software development. As I embark on the next chapter of my career, I
          am eager to bring my expertise and insights to a new team, confident
          that my contributions will be instrumental in driving success and
          innovation in your organization.
